<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

askmonk a.k.a "Tuteur de Mistral" is an innovative open-source tool developed to address a common challenge many developers face: the daunting task of navigating and understanding unfamiliar codebases. Created during the Mistral AI Hackathon at Shack 15, organized by Cerebral Valley, this project leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide users with a seamless and educational experience in coding. "Tuteur de Mistral" is more than just a project; it's a step towards making coding more accessible and less intimidating for developers everywhere.<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Features

* Demystifying Codebases: Utilizes Mistral Large, MongoDB Vector Store, and Llama-Index to analyze and break down complex codebases into understandable parts, offering step-by-step instructions to users.
* Interactive Tutorial Quiz: Incorporates a quiz feature that tests users on foundational knowledge, facilitating a deeper understanding and retention of the code they are learning.
* Speed and Efficiency: Built with the power of Mistral, our tool demonstrates how complex products can be developed rapidly and efficiently, thanks to the streamlined RAG pipeline using Mistral API and Llama-Index.
* Open-Source Accessibility: As an open-source product, "Tuteur de Mistral" encourages community contributions and collaboration, ensuring continuous improvement and accessibility for all users.
